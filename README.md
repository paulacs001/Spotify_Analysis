# Spotify_Analysis
Web Analytics project using data from Spotify and Genius to create a country-based music taste analyzer and recommender

## Project Structure:

> Spoti_API: This notebook is used for the collection of data

> NLP_Lyrics: Notebook used for analyzing the information from Genius (song lyrics). Analysis of the underlying topics in the lyrics and see relation with the pre-labeled moods.
>
> MoodsRecommender: Given the unsatisfactory results from NLP, we try to use KNN for mood prediction based on audio features of songs. Improved results.

> Tops_Analysis: This notebook explores the Spotify data in order to create an interactive dashboard. We explore country similarities, most streamed artists, most popular moods and 25 recommended songs.
